Subject: Re: Closure Notice - Trademark Violation Fixed: wordpress-clock

Dear WordPress Plugin Team,

I have corrected the trademark violation in my plugin and request a re-review.

Actions completed:

1. Removed "WordPress" from display name
   - Old: "WordPress Clock"
   - New: "Live Clock Widget"

2. Updated text domain to "live-clock-widget"

3. Confirmed no WordPress logos in banners/icons

4. Performed full security review

5. Increased version to 2.1

6. Updated "Tested up to" to WordPress 6.8

7. Updated code in SVN trunk and created tag 2.1

All changes are live in SVN:
- Trunk: Revision 3392821
- Tag 2.1: Revision 3392822

Plugin URL: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-clock/

Please re-review the plugin for reinstatement.

Thank you,
Mervin Praison
